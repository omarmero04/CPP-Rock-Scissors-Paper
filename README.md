# CPP-Rock-Scissors-Paper
A command-line implementation of the classic Rock, Scissors, Paper game developed in C++. This project supports two modes of play: Player vs. Player and Player vs. Computer. The computer mode utilises the cstdlib and ctime libraries for true random choice generation.

This is an interactive, multi-mode version of the classic Rock, Scissors, Paper game implemented entirely in C++. It offers players the flexibility to compete against a friend (local two-player mode) or test their luck against a randomly selected computer opponent.

✨ Features
Dual Play Modes: Supports both Player vs. Player and Player vs. Computer gameplay.

Multi-Round Support: Players can define the total number of rounds for the match.

Randomness: The computer's choice is determined using the rand() and srand() functions for pseudo-random generation.

Clear Logic: Uses #define statements to clearly map integers (0, 1, 2) to game choices (rock, scissors, paper).

Terminal Interface: Built for easy execution and interaction within a command-line environment.
